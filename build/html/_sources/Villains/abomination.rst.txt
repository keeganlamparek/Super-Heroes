**Backstory:**

Emil Blonsky was a spy working for the KGB when he was given a large dose of 
gamma radiation similar to what created the Hulk. As a result of this action, 
Emil was permanently transformed into a large, green monster with extreme physical 
power rivaled only by that of the Hulk. Even though his change is permanent, he
was able to retain his old consciousness through this transformation, unlike the Hulk
who loses most if not all of his control and memory when he transforms.
