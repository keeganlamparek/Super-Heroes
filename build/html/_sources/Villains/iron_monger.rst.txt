**Backstory:**

Obadiah Stane was born to Zebediah Stane, who was a drunkard and was unable to make a career for himself.
When he was a young child, his father returned to the hotel that they had been staying at, having won a
large amount of money while gambling. His father claimed that his luck had changed and was eager to prove
it, so he decided to play Russian roulette with himself. He loaded the gun with one bullet, spun the chamber,
and fired at his own head, killing himself with the first shot. This greatly traumatized Obadiah, who later
decided that his father had realized that the world was his opponent against whom he could not win, and
so he intentionally committed suicide.

By the time he turned 8, Obadiah was completely bald as a result from the trauma
of his father's death. Bullied by his classmates, he became extremely withdrawn and
become very interested in games of chance, specifically chess. He began believing that
life was one big game that his father had lost, and he vowed to himself that he
would never lose at anything.

Throughout his life, Obadiah used the strategy of psychological warfare to win these
"games" throughout his life. This strategy took many different forms throughout his life.
While still in school, he slit the throat of his opponents dog and stuffed it in his
locker in order to beat them later on in a chess tournament. He later took control
of the company that he worked for by faking photographs of his boss's wife engaged
in an affair in order to tank his morale and take over himself.

Stane also used this tactic against Iron Man himself, employing different tactics to
get him to start drinking again. He eventually proved successful and took over Tony Stark's
business as a result, but he continued to try to break him down. On many of these occasions,
Iron Man appeared and saved the day. Obadiah soon came to realize that Stark had made the
suit and was in fact using it. He had his scientists create a similar suit based on a
notebook that had been found in the building that had been Stark's. He soon took
this suit to battle, giving it the name "Iron Monger". He was defeated by Iron Man
and ended up committing suicide at the end of the battle.
