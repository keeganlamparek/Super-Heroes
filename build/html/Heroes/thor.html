<dd><p class="first">Thor is a being of an ancient, powerful civilization in the magical realm of Asguard. His father, Odin, wanted a son who could exceed his power. Odin and Gaea, the goddess of earth, gave birth to Thor in a small cave in Norway. Odin took him from Earth to be raised and trained in Asguard. Once Thor was trained for several years, he was gifted the hammer Mjolnir. When Thor obtained the hammer, he was declared as the greatest warrior of Asguard.</p>
<p>Although Thor was a great warrior and reigned victorious, he became head strong and prideful. One battle, he almost broke a truce between the Frost Giants and the Asgardians. Odin was not happy with Thor, so he stripped him of his powers and sent him to Earth as a crippled medical student known as Donald Blake. He began a private practice as a doctor and fell in love with Jane Foster.</p>
<p class="last">After being on Earth for 10 years, Odin told Thor to go to his birthplace in Norway. Thor was warned about an attack on Earth from the alien race of Kronans. Once he reached his old birthplace, his walking stick turned into his hammer Miolnir and he regained his powers. He defeated the invasion of the Kronans and pursued his alter-ego of Donald Blake. Donald would turn into Thor when he fought crime. Thor’s adopted brother, Loki, tried to deceit several heroes of Earth, including Thor, into fighting each other. Thor found out about Loki’s devious plan and united with the other heroes of Earth. Alongside with Ironman , Hulk, Ant-man, and the Wasp, they formed the Avengers.</p>
