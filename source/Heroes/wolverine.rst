**Backstory:**
    Wolverineâ€™s past is one that is shrouded in mystery. His memories are full of government secrets, traumatic events, and death. The only thing remembered by Logan was escaping the Weapon X program, which is a program designed to deliberately and inhumanely induce superpowers on individuals for military purposes. Confused and alone in a dark mental state after the escape, Logan saw a bright light of opportunity when approached by Professor Charles Xavier. Xavier gave Logan a chance to fight for the greater good, combatting the horrible people from ever doing similar things to any more people. After Joining the X-Men, Wolverine continues to use his abilities to make the world a better place and continues to fight for the peaceful coexistence of humans and mutants, as well as continues to search for answers of his past.
