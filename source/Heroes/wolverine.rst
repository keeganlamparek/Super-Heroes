**Backstory:**

Wolverineâ€™s past is one that is shrouded in mystery. His memories are full of government secrets, traumatic events, and death. The only thing remembered by Logan was escaping the Weapon X program, which is a program designed to deliberately and inhumanely induce superpowers on individuals for military purposes. While Wolverine was taking part in the Weapon X experimentation unwillingly, the indestructible named Adamantium was forcibly injected into his bloodstream and skeleton. In tandem with his past memories and rage, the Adamantium reacted with his brain, creating an animal-like mentality and adaptations, including his bone claws and, in some iterations, fangs. Confused and alone in a dark mental state after the escape, Logan saw a bright light of opportunity when approached by Professor Charles Xavier. Xavier, the founder of the X-Men, gave Logan a chance to fight for the greater good, preventing the horrible people from ever doing similar things to other people. After Joining the X-Men, Wolverine continues to use his abilities to make the world a better place and continues to fight for the peaceful coexistence of humans and mutants.
