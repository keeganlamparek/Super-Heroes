**Backstory:**

Norman Osborn was the co-owner of a leading New York company, Osborn Industries, which manufactures chemicals, as well as studies robotics. His wife, Emily, died shortly after the birth of his son, Harry, leaving Norman angry and bitter. As Norman was raised by an abusive, alcoholic father, he raised his own son, Harry, in a similar way as his father raised him, dispassionately. Norman was disappointed by his son’s lack of intelligence and drive in the sciences, which ultimately led to Harry’s best friend, Peter Parker, to seemingly become the research-loving son he always wanted.
    
Osborn began testing various chemicals to alter the human body for better business opportunities.  Becoming more and more obsessed with his research, as well as becoming angry for heroes meddling with his affairs, Osborn worked day and night on this prototype serum. With failure piling up batch after batch, Osborn was on the verge of giving up. One fateful day, Norman stumbled upon notes of his business partner, Professor Mendel Stromm, for a more refined strength-enhancing serum. Shortly after, Osborn had Stromm jailed for an accusation of fund embezzlement, leaving the company in his own hands. With the blueprints of the serum in his hands, Osborn could now do what he always wanted, testing it on himself.
    
As Osborn went to test the serum on himself, the unstable concoction exploded in his face, leaving him hospitalized. After this, he found himself to smarter with superhuman strength, with the cost of his sanity. Dissatisfied with what he’s become and believing that Parker may have been the one meddling with the serum leading to the explosion, Osborn took on the Alias of the Green Goblin. His main mission? Seek revenge on Peter Parker at all costs.
