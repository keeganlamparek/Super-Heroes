**Backstory:**

Loki is from the magical realm of Asguard. Odin, the leader of Asguard, led a battle against the Frost Giants and found a baby frost giant among the spoils of war. This baby was Loki. Bor, Odin's father, dying wish was for Odin to adopt a child of his dying enemy. Odin fulfilled this wish by raising Loki as his son. Loki and Thor fought for Odin's attention when they were young. Loki was often jealous of Thor and interfered with the creation of Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, causing the handle of the hammer shorter than intended. 

Loki caused a lot of mischief as a teenager. Odin eventually sent him to jail after being annoyed of his actions. Loki escaped jail and met up with a sorcerer named Eldred. Eldred taught him many spells in the dark arts. Loki betrayed Eldred by offering Eldred's soul to a demon named Surtur. Surtur accepted this deal and Loki stole all of Eldred's land and minions. Loki, with all of his knowledge of the black arts, allied all of the enemies of Asguard. 

Taking advantage of Odin's banishment of Thor, Loki attacked Earth while Thor was in his weakened state of Donald Blake. Loki used many of his minions to attack Earth. When Loki found out about a distress call to Thor from his father, Odin, Loki attempted to trick other heroes of Earth to attack Thor. This backfired on Loki, for the heroes of Earth found out of his trickery, and banded together. They formed the alliance known as the Avengers. Loki highly regretted this, for is responsible of the formation of the Avengers.
