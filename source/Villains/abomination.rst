**Backstory:**

Emil Blonsky was a spy working for the KGB when he was given a large dose of 
gamma radiation similar to what created the Hulk. As a result of this action, 
Emil was permanently transformed into a large, green monster with extreme physical 
power rivaled only by that of the Hulk. Even though his change is permanent, he
was able to retain his old consciousness through this transformation, unlike the Hulk
who loses most if not all of his control and memory when he transforms. 

Because of the similarity of their predicaments, Blonsky blames his condition on the Hulk
(Bruce Banner). This led to many battles between the two, all of which were initiated by 
Blonsky. However, the Hulk manages to triumph every time except for one. 
The Abomination is one of the few that have claimed victory over the green giant.

Despite his one victory, the Abomination eventually was defeated at the hands of the Hulk 
after he had poisoned his wife, Betty Ross. Even after that, Banner forgave Blonsky, and he
realized that he had become what he hated the most. He had become an inhuman monster, which 
is what he had believed the Hulk to be all those years.
